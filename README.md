# Spotify Wrap

This is a mockup of an E-Commerce sites user interface (UI) for a movie purchasing/renting store. User's can can select movies they find from its catalog and simulate purchasing them using the cart. 

Movies are pulled from an API to act as the stores catalog, and firebase is used to store their purchase history and authenticate each user on the site.
